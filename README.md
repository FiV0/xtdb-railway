# XTBD on railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/template/i-rqKj?referralCode=U4HniC)

A simple XTDB railway setup with one node on Railway. The template brings up a single XTDB (v2) node deployment with Kafka and MinIO as Object Storage. You likely want to scale the number of XTDB nodes and number of MinIO buckets for a production setup.
